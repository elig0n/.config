This is a [jgmenu](https://github.com/johanmalm/jgmenu) config which provides clickable launchers for performing i3wm actions with a touch screen. Many icons used were pulled from the [breeze icon theme](https://github.com/KDE/breeze-icons), others were made from scratch. Thanks to reddit user PMunch for [the inspiration](https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/52wgst/i3_with_touch_controls/).
